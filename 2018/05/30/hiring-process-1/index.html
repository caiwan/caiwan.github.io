You have no concept of a knife, you have no knowledge of how slicing a bread works for real. You are only told that the harder you try, the better you will get, so you’ll keep smashing that bread with your spoon, ending up with strange results. It’s commonly told that a if a person even lights up such problems strictly means that person is do suck at life and can’t put the effort to be successful. Well, wou have the bread, you have the spoon, and you have the strength and passion to smash it, so it’s not true that you’re not trying hard enough. You just don’t have the right tools. Basically this is how ridiculous the hiring process can get. If you address your issues, you basically took the first and most important step to get better anything at, rather than being dissatisfied with your conditions.</p>
<p>I made a bit research how hiring process work, ar might be working. Completely different that you might think, or being told, and a same as you feel how it might work under the hood. I have to admit that I can’t solve these problems, but made a closer step to not being screwed up.</p>
<h3 id="Your-CV-can’t-be-good-enough"><a href="#Your-CV-can’t-be-good-enough" class="headerlink" title="Your CV can’t be good enough."></a>Your CV can’t be good enough.</h3><p>It might be an obvious statement that the perfect CV does not exists. Well, It’s highly up to the HR what kind of CV they look for, so basically yo have to deal with a sort of lottery on the first trial. </p>
<p>Here in Hungary, two major format of CV is accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>American</strong> type which looks like a RP character page; only contains brief information to give an overview of you - personally I prefer this because of the compact format - but on the other hand does not give a detailed information of who you are</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <strong>European</strong> type, which gives a longer and detailed information about you, to give opportunity to review your application more depth, but the downside of it is too long to get through it and make a quick decision if the HR have to process lots of candidates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So you’re dealing with 50% of chance, which lowers and lowers as the conditions grows.</p>
<h3 id="The-have-to-process-a-lot-of-candidates"><a href="#The-have-to-process-a-lot-of-candidates" class="headerlink" title="The have to process a lot of candidates"></a>The have to process a lot of candidates</h3><p>This is the biggest lie that is ever being told. They in fact are well prepared for large amount of candidates, and they have polished and well working process to do that. They use first-come-first-served method, with fairly high and strict conditions that you have to meet. The vast majority of them are untold and unwritten, as well as specialized to the companies inter needs, which makes even harder to get through it. Unless you don’t have a close friend there who told lots about how do they work there.</p>
<p>Let say, they have 100 candidates, and they have to choose 5 from them. As the fifth candidate is chosen, the hiring process is over, and doesn’t matter if the sixth would beat the first five alone. How do the know if there’s a sixth person? They continue the process on, despites it’s over or monitor the market with fake opportunities, and fake tests. Also they use an internal feedback system to refine their conditions for future candidates.</p>
<h3 id="Pure-waste-of-time"><a href="#Pure-waste-of-time" class="headerlink" title="Pure waste of time"></a>Pure waste of time</h3><p>To make HR their work faster and efficient, they will do the decision process in parallel with the interview. As they have their strict rules and conditions, as you’ve failed on one, or not satisfy their needs, the decision had been made, and your CV probably will end up in the trash right after the interview. <em>Thus, they won’t call you soon, as they’ve promise.</em> There are plenty of sighs that you’ve already faield, and though saying so is the most polite way to say goodbye. That would rude from everyone if the guards would stop you in the corridor because you didn’t gave the best first impression.<br>In fact the 99% of the time spent with the interviews and the tests are purely wasted.</p>
<h3 id="Make-your-time-wasted"><a href="#Make-your-time-wasted" class="headerlink" title="Make your time wasted"></a>Make your time wasted</h3><p>Measuring the candidates knowege is a good idea, instead of approxximate from their CV. On the other hand, 60% of the candidates are actually satisfies the techical needs, after preselection 99% of the would do. For smaller companies who have the time and effort will actually take care of the tests, but for a copany who has to deal with hundreds of candidates, processing tests would be a big shoot on the foot. Because preselection works so well, filling assessments are actually making your time to be wasted instead of yours. It’s more than a polite way for them to make themselves look so professional, and claiming that you are not satify their needs. You’d double check, and you’ll be suspicious, and it adds an extra how fast they are. </p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>As it turns out a more in-depth knowlege and satisfaction of hidden needs are needed. I have not much to say at this point, the possible solution wold be to find a good practice to bypass these issues more efficiently. I’d probaly write another post about it what my results are.</p>
