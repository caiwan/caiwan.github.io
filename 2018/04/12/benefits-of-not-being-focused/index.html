It’s the dependency-hierarchy modal that keeps a person motivated. Sounds cool right? Isn’t sounds the ultimate weapon of managers of companies? Because it is. </p>
<p>In the future there will be no need for engineers, just HR and Management  team. The members of this master race will find the right labor, and will allocate them at the right place, where managing them is the necessary thing. No thinking and planing is needed, just for the right people: the managers. In their theory, if the right people are found for a task, and they are being managed well, no further intervention<br> is needed.</p>
<p>Software development is way more than a rock art profession. It has rules, it has principles which has to be considered, to make a good product. There are also a ton of practices, which also should considered. But noone wants to think about it. In reality, in the most of the cases development is just nothing more than write stuff where the cursor blinks until the poor and stupid computer does not do what the manager wants.<br>There are a ton of manager bullshit that there are so many abstract things out there that they have to consider and so on. Let me tell you what: there is an effective way to do that. But for them, the code is just a weird line of computer texts, whit some classes with some <em>functions</em>, sprinkled around with another classes with some  <em>variables</em> in it. No testing, no planning needed, just write what was told, and make the manager satisfied. Oh, and don’t forget to stay overtime and work on weekends just because the lack of it. Be reliable please.</p>
<p>How these things come together? A person is motivated, while there is an unsatisfied dependency fot them. So, one dependency should not be satisfied. The easiest to distract of prevent its purpose is the safety-level of the pyramid - or the function of Svadhishthana chakra. When you are determined, when you can keep things in hand, you are in a level of safety. If it does work, you will have to realize that no further dependencies can be satisfied such as need of social connection, like only loose connection to the rest of the team and so on. The state of being unsafe, will end in depending on others, resulting in a Stockholm syndrome towards your employees to stay there. </p>
<p>The way that your superiors pushes tasks, and with them countless responsibilities makes harder to organize and priorize. In many their ignorance will result in pushing that resposibilites that they should responsible for. Like check your work. They will forget that, right and at the production stage everything will goes on fire and so on. </p>
<p>The overall conclusion is avoid these situations at all costs, and don’t work for or go away from such places who does that. For simpliciy peole are too dumb to do their jobs properly at many levels.</p>
